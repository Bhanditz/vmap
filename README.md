Digital Video Multiple Ad Playlist
==================================

The IAB Video Multiple Ad Playlist (VMAP) specification is an XML template that video content owners can use to describe the structure for ad inventory insertion when they donâ€™t control the video player or the content distribution outlet.

For more information about the VMAP specification, visit the [Digital Video Multiple Ad Playlist](http://www.iab.net/guidelines/508676/digitalvideo/vsuite/vmap) on the IAB.net website.
